<blockquote><p>MT: Replace a semicolon (;) with a greek question mark (;) in your friend&#39;s C# code and watch them pull their hair out over the syntax error</p>&mdash; Peter Ritchie (@peterritchie) <a href="https://twitter.com/peterritchie/status/534011965132120064">November 16, 2014</a></blockquote>

*chaos* is a pastejacking tool which modifies text copied to the operating system clipboard. The idea is to replace the ASCII character semicolon (;) with an identical looking Unicode character Greek question mark (;) as soon as any text is copied to the clipboard, so that when a user tries to compile some copied code, their life becomes harder.
